# Cohort Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains scripts and notebooks for performing cohort analysis on customer transaction data. Cohort analysis is a technique used to understand the behavior of customers over time, grouping them based on shared characteristics or experiences within a specified time frame.

## Dataset
The data used in this project is sourced from the **Online Retail II Data Set** available on Kaggle, provided by the ML Repository. This dataset contains transactional data from an online retail store over a period of approximately two years (from December 2009 to December 2011). It includes sales made to customers who are primarily wholesalers.
